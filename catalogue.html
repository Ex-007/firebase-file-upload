                The AVR is automatic voltage regulator and it is a device which is used to regulate or stabilize electrical power supply for electrical or electronic appliances

                In this project, therefore, we are interested in the construction of this all important device. Furthermore, we shall discuss the techniques, processes, switching stages and then the working principle of the automatic voltage regulator

                Chapter one of this project dwells on the introduction of the project topic. It also talks about the objectives of the project, bringing to mind what we intend to achieve at the end

                Chapter two of the project reviews the research works that have been carried out by some other people in this study area. It also discusses on some of the components used in this project

                Chapter three gives a detailed account of the basic construction and the operation of the AVR. It also highlights on some other components used, discussing their working principles using both the circuit and block diagrams.

                Temperature rise is of much concern in the short and long term operations of
                induction machine, the most useful industrial work icon. This work examines
                induction machines mean temperatures at the different core parts of the
                machine. The system’s thermal network is developed, the algebraic and
                differential equations for the proposed models are solved so as to ascertain the
                thermal performances of the machine under steady and transient conditions.
                The lumped parameter thermal method is used to estimate the temperature rise
                in induction machine. This method is achieved using thermal resistances,
                thermal capacitances and power losses. To analyze the thermal process, the
                7.5kW machine is divided geometrically into a number of lumped components,
                each component having a bulk thermal storage and heat generation and
                interconnections to adjacent components through a linear mesh of thermal
                impedances. The lumped parameters are derived entirely from dimensional
                information, the thermal properties of the materials used in the design, and
                constant heat transfer coefficients. The thermal circuit in steady-state condition

            <P>
                Earthing and lightning protection systems protect people from the danger of electrocution
                and equipment from over-voltages by dissipating the excess energy into the earth, and at
                the same time reducing the potential difference between equipment and earth. This study
                investigated the effect of lightning strikes on people, buildings, communication towers
                and equipment by determining the number of lightning strikes on the structures
                depending on their location and height as well as the earthing resistances. With the aid of
                data obtained from April 1995 to February 2003, from the National Aeronautic and Space
                Agency (NASA), Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) Science Team and from NASA’s
                Optical Transient Detector and colour coded onto a map, the annual flash rate for Zaria
                was obtained. Based on this, the number of lightning strikes on two structures; the control
                tower of the Zaria Aerodrome and the communication tower of the Zaria Nitel Exchange;
                were determined. The Fall-of-Potential Method (also referred to as Earth-Spike Method)
                was method used for the earth resistance measurement. The null-balance analogue type
                Megger Earth Tester was used as the test instrument to determine the earth resistance of
                the following locations within Zaria: Department of Electrical Engineering, Zaria
                Aerodrome Control Tower, Commercial Complex, No. 8 Sokoto Road and Nitel
                Exchange Communication Tower. The earth resistance measurements taken for the
                various locations were in conformity with the general standards: “The resistance to earth
                of the earth electrode subsystem should not exceed 10Ω at fixed permanent facilities”.
                All the earthing resistances measured around the ring earth of the Nitel Communication
                Tower were within NITEL recommended resistance of less than 1Ω.

            <h2>MANAGEMENT OF CHANGE IN NIGERIAN ORGANISATIONS</h2>
        </div>

            <div class="abstract">
                <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
            </div>
            <P>
                The issue of change has always been a recurring one in organization. 
                 Management has always had problems in initiating change in organizations 
                 because employees prefer to stick to the old method of doing things.  
                 This project took a look at five firms to examine how change can be managed 
                 in these organizations while also getting the employee involved in the change process. 
                  In achieving this objective, a number of research tools were employed such as the questionnaire, 
                  oral interviews etc.  In the course of this study, the researcher discovered that though 
                  employees would most times resist change, that there were processes to be taken in order 
                  to reduce this resistance to change, one of which was to ensure employee involvement in the change process.  
                  It was conclusively deduced that managing change is a dynamic process which requires being constantly tuned 
                  in to what is happening around and monitoring the process carefully. This study recommended that for effective 
                  change process in organizations, top management must be committed to the change process; and most importantly
                   the parties that would be affected by the change must be involved in the change process thus resistance to 
                   change will be reduced. It is the belief of the researcher that this study will become a reference tool for 
                   managing change in organizations.

                This project work is carried out to examine the impact of financial statement
                 on financial management decision making of an incorporation. 
                 The Brass micro finance bank is used as a case study. Data were collected 
                 through a well structured questionnaire and the information elicited from the 
                 respondents were analyzed through tabular presentation of data, frequency distribution 
                 and percentages. The findings revealed that financial statement have contributed 
                 immensely to the financial management decisions of small scale business in Nigeria 
                 and most especially Banks.
